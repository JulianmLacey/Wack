## Description
This is a open source project board designed with collaboration in mind. You can create a project and other people can add tasks and complete tasks. You can comment on other projects as well to let them know what you think. If you love a project, go ahead and work on some of the tasks even add your own. Visit the deployed site [here.](https://blooming-beyond-30251-89ceb9e97d3f.herokuapp.com/)

## Learning-Points

A big learning point from this project that we walked away with was the intricate path EVERY action on the website followed.  Weather it was signing up, logging in, creating content, deleting content or commenting on content, each stap involed a sequence of actions across various files.  For example, creating a User model, capturing user input with client-side JavaScript, sending that data as a string to our API for validation against the database, and finally routing valid users to the appropriate Handlebars HTML page.  It was so easy to "get lost in the sauce" and get confused about the path we must take to get an action to work on the webpage. Having partners to this out with and have a fresh set of eyes on the code was a HUGE asset and a big reason I believe we are walking away from this project with more knowledge and confidence with building a web app that we had at the begining of this project.
